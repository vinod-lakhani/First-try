1. Can you add this down payment savings plan to my financial plan?
2. If I’m saving 2k per month for my down payment, then when can I buy a house? Also where should this money exist while I’m saving it, in a bank account, in the stock market, high yield savings account, ETF, etc?
3. I don’t think I can afford to save 3.4k a month for my down payment because this is my entire saving and investing category. Give me something a little more reasonable with what I can reduce from my “wants” spending
4. I’m living in the Bay Area, when would I be able to to buy a house or apartment? Nothing fancy, just an average starter home. I also don’t know how much I should be saving every month so that I have enough to pay for the down payment
5. Am I on track compared to other people my age?
