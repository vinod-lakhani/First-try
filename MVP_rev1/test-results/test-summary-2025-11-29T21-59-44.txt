"what can I do to increase my net worth by an additional $100,000 in 5 years"

Response:
Based on your current plan, you're projected to have **$127,985** in net worth in 5 years. To reach **$227,985** (your current projection plus an additional **$100,000**), you need to increase your net worth by **$100,000**.

### Calculation:

1. **Monthly Savings Needed**:
   - Total increase needed: **$100,000**
   - Time frame: **5 years** (60 months)
   - Required monthly savings: **$100,000 / 60 months = $1,666.67/month**

2. **Allocation through Savings Priority Stack**:
   - Emergency Fund (up to 40% of additional savings): 
     - **$1,666.67 × 0.40 = $666.67** 
   - High-APR Debt Payoff (if applicable): 
     - Assume no debt here, so **$0**.
   - Retirement Contributions:
     - The remaining amount goes into retirement: 
     - **$1,666.67 - $666.67 = $1,000**.

### Summary of Needed Monthly Savings:
- **Emergency Fund**: **$666.67**
- **Retirement**: **$1,000**

To achieve this goal, you would need to save approximately **$1,666.67 per month**. You can explore different scenarios using the **Savings Helper tool** to find the most comfortable savings rate and see the projected impact on your net worth.
