Hi [First Name]! 👋

Hope you're doing well! Quick question - do you know any recent grads who might be struggling with money management?

I recently started WeLeap (weleap.ai) - a financial sidekick built for recent grads. The idea came from watching the next generation, including our own kids, struggle with little guidance.

What started as personal frustration quickly revealed a much larger problem affecting countless Gen Z graduates.

🎯 Here's how you can help (30 seconds):
• Forward this to recent grads you know
• Join our waitlist: weleap.ai

Every referral helps us build something truly useful for the next generation.

Thanks so much! Let me know if you make any intros so I can thank them personally.

Gratefully,
Vinod
Co-founder, WeLeap
