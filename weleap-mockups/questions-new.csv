### Bonus Allocation Steps
Assuming your bonus is **$1,000**:

1. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Current gap: **$1,953** (target) - **$0** (current) = **$1,953** gap.
   - Cap at 40% of bonus: **$1,000 × 0.40 = $400**.
   - Allocate: **$400** to Emergency Fund.

2. **Remaining after Emergency Fund**:
   - **$1,000 - $400 = $600**.

3. **High-APR Debt Payoff**:
   - Total high-APR debt balance: **$2,000** at 10% APR.
   - Cap at 40% of remaining: **$600 × 0.40 = $240**.
   - Allocate: **$240** to debt.

4. **Remaining after Debt Payoff**:
   - **$600 - $240 = $360**.

5. **Retirement vs. Brokerage Split**:
   - Given your high retirement focus, let’s allocate:
     - Retirement: 70%
     - Brokerage: 30%
   - Allocate:
     - Retirement: **$360 × 0.70 = $252**.
     - Brokerage: **$360 × 0.30 = $108**.

### Summary of Allocation
- **Emergency Fund**: **$400**
- **High-APR Debt Payoff**: **$240**
- **Retirement**: **$252**
- **Brokerage**: **$108**

"11/30/2025, 7:49:18 AM",financial-sidekick,success,I want to save 2000 in the next 2 month,"To save **$2,000** in the next **2 months**, you'll need to save **$1,000** per month.

Here's how that would fit into your current plan:

### Current Savings Situation:
- **Current monthly savings**: **$975**
- **Target monthly savings needed**: **$1,000**
- **Shortfall**: **$25/month**

### Recommended Action:
Since you need to save **$1,000** each month, you will need to adjust your current savings to meet this goal. 

You could consider reducing your discretionary spending (Wants) to make up for the **$25** shortfall. 

Your current allocation is:
- **Needs**: **$25**
- **Wants**: **$0**
- **Savings**: **$975**

You can either adjust your Wants to allocate more towards savings or look for ways to increase your income temporarily to cover this additional savings goal.",781,gpt-4o-mini
