## Vercel Web Analytics Installation and Configuration

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js App Router project.

### Changes Made:

1. **Installed @vercel/analytics package** (v1.6.1)
   - Used npm to install the package
   - Updated package.json and package-lock.json

2. **Modified app/layout.tsx**
   - Added import: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next';`
   - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag after `{children}`
   - This ensures analytics tracking is enabled across all pages in the app

### Files Modified:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency resolution

### Implementation Details:
- This is an App Router project (uses `app` directory structure)
- The Analytics component was placed in the root layout file to track all pages
- Positioned after {children} in the body tag as recommended by Vercel
- Preserves all existing code structure and styling

### Verification:
- Build completed successfully with `npm run build`
- All 48 pages generated without errors
- No TypeScript or compilation errors
- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and web vitals when deployed to Vercel

### Notes:
- ESLint is not yet configured in this project (detected during verification)
- The build process includes type checking which passed successfully
- Analytics will be functional immediately upon deployment to Vercel
- No additional configuration is required - the component works out of the box
