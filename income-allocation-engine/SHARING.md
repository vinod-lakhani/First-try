# How to Share the Net Worth Simulator

Your code is now on GitHub at: `https://github.com/vinod-lakhani/First-try`

## Option 1: Direct File Link (Easiest)

Share the raw GitHub file link:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinod-lakhani/First-try/main/income-allocation-engine/standalone/net-worth-interactive.html
```

**Note:** Users can right-click this link → "Save As" to download, or you can use it in an iframe.

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (Recommended - Live URL)

### Setup Steps:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/vinod-lakhani/First-try

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Click **Settings** (top menu)
   - Scroll to **Pages** (left sidebar)
   - Under **Source**, select:
     - Branch: `main`
     - Folder: `/income-allocation-engine/standalone`
   - Click **Save**

3. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for GitHub to build your site

4. **Your live URL will be:**
   ```
   https://vinod-lakhani.github.io/First-try/net-worth-interactive.html
   ```

5. **Share this URL** with your team!

### Alternative: Use index.html

If you want a cleaner URL, you can:
1. Copy `net-worth-interactive.html` to `index.html` in the standalone folder
2. Then your URL will be: `https://vinod-lakhani.github.io/First-try/`

## Option 3: Share via GitHub Repository

Simply share the repository link:
```
https://github.com/vinod-lakhani/First-try/tree/main/income-allocation-engine/standalone
```

Team members can:
- View the file on GitHub
- Click "Raw" to see the source
- Download the file

## Option 4: Create a Release

1. Go to **Releases** → **Create a new release**
2. Tag: `v1.0.0`
3. Title: "Net Worth Simulator v1.0"
4. Upload `net-worth-interactive.html` as an asset
5. Share the release link

## Quick Test

After setting up GitHub Pages, test your URL:
```bash
curl -I https://vinod-lakhani.github.io/First-try/net-worth-interactive.html
```
