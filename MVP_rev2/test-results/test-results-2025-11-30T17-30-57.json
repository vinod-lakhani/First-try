It allows you to cover essential expenses without resorting to high-interest debt, such as credit cards.

      "category": "General Financial Literacy",
      "answer": "Automating savings helps ensure that you consistently set aside money for your goals without having to think about it each month. It simplifies the process, making it easier to build an emergency fund or save for retirement because the funds are transferred automatically from your checking account to your savings or investment accounts. This not only promotes discipline in saving but also helps you avoid the temptation to spend that money instead. Over time, automation can lead to significant savings growth due to the power of compound interest.",

In contrast, fixed spending includes necessary expenses that are typically consistent each month, like rent or mortgage payments, utilities, and insurance. Fixed spending is essential for maintaining basic living standards, while discretionary spending can vary and be modified based on financial goals or circumstances.",

As prices rise, the amount you can buy with your savings decreases, which means that if your savings growth doesn't outpace inflation, you might not be able to maintain your lifestyle or achieve your financial goals. It's important to consider investment options that typically offer growth potential above the inflation rate, like stocks or other assets, rather than keeping all your savings in low-interest accounts.",
